                <p> Hi, My name is Chobu Kangkolo and I was born in Cameroon, West Africa. I have lived in the United
                    States for about 20 years and i've spent the majority of that time here in Kansas City, Missouri. I
                    have also lived in Texas, Maryland and Georgia but of all those places, I prefer Missouri.

                </p>

            <div class="row">
               
                <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> I am experiencing the joys of being a father to my 6 month old daughter Eliora and when i'm not with
                    her I am either playing video games, drawing or working out. I am an avid an sports fan so much so
                    that I fall asleep to Sportcenter. When I have the time, I love taking pictures around the city and
                    binge watching documentaries on netflix. </p></div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <p>From time to time, I challenge myself to master new ideas and to learn more about my different interests.
                One of those interests which could possibly reap great rewards if mastered are computers. I am currently
                taking a break from my undergrad program at NWMSU to learn coding skills which could hopefully make me
                desirable in the growing tech world. </p>
